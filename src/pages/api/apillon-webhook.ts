/**
 * This endpoint is designed to handle webhook notifications from the Apillon platform. 
 * It processes different types of events related to the lifecycle of files stored on IPFS via Apillon's infrastructure:
 * 
 * 1. **FILE_UPLOADED**: Logs the details of the file that was successfully uploaded.
 * 2. **FILE_TRANSFERRED**: Confirms that the file has been transferred to IPFS, indicating it is now stored on the decentralized web.
 * 3. **FILE_REPLICATED**: Acknowledges that the file has been replicated across the Crust Network, ensuring higher availability and redundancy.
 *
 * The webhook validates the authorization token to secure the endpoint against unauthorized access. This setup is crucial for real-time event handling 
 * in applications that rely on decentralized storage solutions, ensuring that actions can be triggered responsively as file states change on the network.
